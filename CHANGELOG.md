# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- CSS: Audited and deduplicated UI styles. Replaced inline style toggles with CSS classes (`hidden`,
  `evd-visible`, `evd-on-dark`, `evd-on-light`), unified z-index variable (`--z-max`), and
  consolidated floating button states into `content.css`. Updated TS to toggle classes instead of
  setting inline `display`/`opacity`.
- Code Quality: Eliminated remaining pyright warnings by tightening types in `config_bp.py` and
  explicitly referencing nested Flask error handler in `__init__.py`. Fixed implicit string
  concatenation in `download_bp.py` and cleaned import ordering in CLI status command.
- Frontend: Standardized API usage to current endpoints (`/api/health`, `/api/logs`,
  `/api/logs/clear`). Updated tests to reflect non-throwing error handling and contrast-aware button
  styling. Removed legacy log endpoint fallbacks and adjusted YouTube enhancement positioning
  expectations.

- Backend cleanup: Removed deprecated legacy modules and unified helpers

  - Dropped `server/video_downloader_server.py` legacy shim (now raises ImportError); use
    `python -m server` or `videodownloader-server` CLI
  - Removed `server/cli_commands/lifecycle.py` shims (now raises ImportError); use consolidated
    commands in `server/cli_main.py`
  - Unified port discovery by delegating `server/cli_helpers.find_available_port` to
    `server/utils.find_available_port`

- CLI: `videodownloader-server stop` now terminates all running server instances discovered on the
  system, not just the one referenced by the lock file. This improves reliability when multiple
  instances are started (e.g., via foreground and daemon runs). Use `--force` to immediately kill if
  graceful termination times out.

- CLI Utils: Implemented `run_cleanup()` to remove `*.part` and `*.ytdl` artifacts using configured
  download directory. Added tests for normal and missing-dir cases. Minor logging tweaks in API
  cleanup paths to avoid silent failures.

- Resume: Implemented real `gallery-dl` resume path in CLI helpers. The resume logic now builds a
  `gallery-dl` command from provided options (bool → `--flag`, scalar → `--flag value`, list →
  repeated flags), forces `--continue` by default, respects `--directory`, and returns success based
  on the subprocess exit code. Added a unit test to validate command construction and success
  handling via subprocess mocking. README updated to describe gallery resume behavior.

### Removed

- Deprecated UI stylesheet `extension/ui/styles.css` removed. UI now uses modular styles:
  `variables.css`, `components.css`, `base.css`, and `themes.css`.

### Fixed

- Options page Choose button wired to directory picker (`settings-folder-picker`), aligning with
  current implementation in `options.ts`.

### Testing & Tooling

- Constrain Hypothesis property tests to write any generated directories under
  `tmp/hypothesis_download_dirs` and explicitly load a Hypothesis profile storing examples in
  `.hypothesis/examples`, preventing junk folders at repo root.
- Update `Makefile` junk folder checker to ignore `.benchmarks` (created by benchmarking), aligning
  with the cleanup script's critical folders.

### Security

- Add standard security headers to all responses (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options,
  X-XSS-Protection, Referrer-Policy, CSP)
- Configure CORS for local usage/extension contexts (permissive by default; recommend restricting in
  production)
- Enforce request size limits (16MB) with JSON 413 responses
- Add simple in-memory rate limiting for download endpoints (10 req/min per IP)

### Comprehensive Extension Build Process

- **Issue Resolution**: Configured complete `npm run build` pipeline for frontend extension
- **Build Pipeline**: Enhanced to include clean, CSS processing, HTML copying, TypeScript
  compilation, and verification
- **TypeScript Fix**: Fixed compilation to use extension-specific `tsconfig.json` with proper output
  directory

  files, 6 icons)

- **Status**: **COMPLETED** - `npm run build` now performs all required steps for complete extension
  build

### CSS Loading and Manifest Issues Fixed

- **Issue Resolution**: Fixed extension loading failures with CSS and manifest errors
- **Root Cause**: Build process not copying CSS and HTML files to `extension/dist/` directory
- **CSS Build Process**: Updated `scripts/minify-css.js` to copy files to dist directory
- **HTML Copy Process**: Created `scripts/copy-html.js` to copy HTML files to dist directory

- **Manifest Compatibility**: Fixed manifest.json file path references to match actual file
  locations
- **Status**: **COMPLETED** - Extension should now load successfully without CSS or manifest errors

### Service Worker Registration Fix (Second Fix)

- **Issue Resolution**: Fixed service worker registration failure with status code 3 - undefined
  variables
- **Root Cause**: Variables `downloadQueue` and `activeDownloads` not properly compiled to
  JavaScript
- **Solution**: Added explicit variable declarations to compiled background.js file
