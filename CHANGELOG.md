adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Downloads List Styling Improvements**: Enhanced visual hierarchy, spacing, and button consistency
  - **Visual Hierarchy**: Improved spacing between elements and consistent row heights (48px minimum)
  - **Button Styling**: Unified button appearance with consistent sizes (32px × 28px) and hover effects
  - **Status Display**: Enhanced status pills with proper padding, borders, and semantic color classes
  - **Typography**: Increased font sizes and improved line heights for better readability
  - **Interactive States**: Added hover effects and smooth transitions for all interactive elements
  - **Dark Theme Support**: Ensured consistency across light and dark themes
  - **Result**: More professional, accessible, and visually appealing downloads list interface

- **downloadId Consistency Updates**: Completed Phase 1 of system-wide `download_id` → `downloadId` conversion
  - **ytdlp.py**: Updated all 50+ references to use camelCase `downloadId` consistently
  - **Unified System**: Now uses `UnifiedDownloadManager` instead of separate queue/progress systems
  - **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains support for legacy `download_id` input fields
  - **Status**: Core server files updated, test files pending update

- **downloadId Consistency Updates - Phase 2 Complete**: Successfully updated all test files to use unified system
  - **Test Files Updated**: 8 test files updated to use `UnifiedDownloadManager` instead of old `DownloadQueueManager`
  - **System Unification**: All tests now use consistent unified download management system
  - **Behavior Changes**: Progress tracking now uses unified manager instead of direct `progress_data` updates
  - **Status**: Test file updates complete, some tests need adjustment for new unified behavior

- **Fix "Original URL unavailable for retry" Issue**: Resolved history entries with null URLs
  - **Root Cause**: Test processes were creating real history entries without proper cleanup
  - **Server Validation**: Enhanced URL validation in download endpoints and unified download manager
  - **Test Isolation**: Added automatic cleanup fixture to prevent test processes from persisting
  - **History Cleanup**: Removed existing entries with null URLs and enhanced history creation validation
  - **Frontend Enhancement**: Improved retry button logic with fallback URL support and better error messages
  - **Result**: History now guaranteed to have valid URLs, eliminating "URL unavailable" errors

- Refactor (extension): centralized and de-duplicated hardcoded strings

  - Message types → `MESSAGE_TYPES`; replaced inline `sendMessage({ type: "..." })` and switch cases
    across `background.ts`, `content.ts`, `popup.ts`, `options.ts`, `history.ts`
  - Storage keys → `STORAGE_KEYS`; replaced literal keys like `theme`, `activeDownloads`,
    `serverConfig`, `serverPort`, `configError`
  - CSS classes → `CSS_CLASSES`; replaced many `classList.add/remove/toggle("...")` in
    popup/options/history/content (status pills, drag state, visibility, server status)
  - DOM selectors → `DOM_SELECTORS`; replaced hardcoded `getElementById`/`querySelector` strings in
    popup/options for server status, history pagination, and controls
  - API paths → `NETWORK_CONSTANTS` (`LOGS_ENDPOINT`, `LOGS_CLEAR_ENDPOINT`, legacy fallbacks);
    background log endpoints now built from constants
  - Status literals → `STATUS_CONSTANTS` (connected/disconnected/checking) used by popup/options
  - Minor: exported a few background helpers for tests and hardened `updateIcon` error handling in
    test mode

## [2025.8.15] - 2025-08-15

### Changed

- **Logging Improvements**: Reduced log noise and improved log management
  - **Change-based logging**: Status and queue endpoints now only log when download/queue counts change
  - **Log file rotation**: Clear logs endpoint now properly archives to `.bak` and creates fresh log files
  - **Overwrite existing backups**: Existing `.bak` files are overwritten instead of creating multiple timestamped backups
  - **Reduced log spam**: Eliminated repetitive logging of unchanged status/queue information
  - **Structured initialization**: New log files include JSON initialization entries for better debugging

- Extension/server config flow hardening:
- **Consolidated download history**: server now writes to a single history JSON file resolved at
  runtime.
  - **default path**: `<download_dir>/history.json` (override via `HISTORY_FILE` env or Options →
    History File)
  - **wiring**: all history endpoints and CLI clear operations honor the resolved path
  - **cleanup**: yt-dlp sidecar `.info.json` files are ingested into history and then removed
- Background now retries config GET/POST across http/https and 127.0.0.1/localhost/[::1] with
  timeouts
- When saving settings with a new `server_port`, background immediately caches the new port and
  tries the new port first, then falls back once to the previous port if needed
- Options save now posts only non-empty fields to avoid overwriting server defaults; after a
  successful save, if any fields are blank locally, it fetches `/api/config` and populates only the
  missing fields
- Centralized logger no longer prints a trailing `undefined` when no data payload is supplied

### E2E and Detection

- Added event-driven media detection in content script (MutationObserver + debounced user events) to
  re-scan when videos/iframes attach or attributes change, without removing interval polling.
- Expanded E2E player API hooks (Facebook, Wistia, Brightcove, TikTok, Twitter/X, Reddit,
  SoundCloud, VK) and added scroll/click heuristics for lazy-loaded media; richer `[MATRIX][DBG]`
  diagnostics.
- Extended domain config (`tests/extension/media-domains.json`) with consent/play
  selectors/timeouts.
- Introduced `test-media-wide` and `matrix-seq` Make targets; wide runs gated, sequential runner
  summarizes results.
- Added `scripts/update_ad_origins.py` and `make update-ad-origins` to refresh ad-origin hints from
  uBO lists.

- Extension background UX:
  - Prefer cached/configured port; scan only if missing (reduced noisy discovery)
  - Popup/Options initialize server status immediately via message to background
  - Clear stale scan badge on connect; compact scanning badge text set to "SCN"
  - Config fetch tries 127.0.0.1/localhost/[::1] and falls back to cached config if network fails

### Added

- Smart Injection option for the inline Download button
- **Options**
  - Server → Runtime: History File (consolidated) path field
  - Download Settings: yt-dlp controls for cookies-from-browser, merge container, continue partials,
    fragment retries
- New toggle in Options → Behavior → General Options
- When enabled, the content script only shows the button when a downloadable video is detected;
  otherwise it stays hidden
- Popup SHOW/HIDE per-domain toggle still applies on top of smart mode

### Fixed

- Server `/api/config` responses consistently include permissive CORS headers for OPTIONS/GET/POST
  to allow the extension to call from chrome-extension:// contexts

- Popup: Prevent "The provided double value is non-finite" error by sanitizing and clamping active
  download progress values in `createActiveListItem` to the [0, 100] range and rounding the
  displayed percentage.
- Extension background messaging: prevent noisy connection errors by ensuring broadcast
  `chrome.runtime.sendMessage(...)` calls handle the no-receiver case via callbacks or
  `.catch(...)`. This occurs when popup/options are not open.
- Server startup log duplication: guard initialization log in `create_app` so "Server application
  initialized ..." writes only once per process even if the app factory is called multiple times
  (e.g., tests, WSGI reloads).
- yt-dlp config parsing noise: accept `yt_dlp_options` provided as JSON strings or Pydantic models;
  continue using safe defaults when types are invalid, reducing warnings like "yt_dlp_options is not
  a dictionary".
- Playwright E2E: Stabilized opt-in real-site test (YouTube Shorts drag-and-click). The test now
  clamps the injected download button into the viewport and falls back to a JS-triggered click when
  actionability fails, preventing intermittent "element is outside of the viewport" failures.
- Content script: Prevent transient disappearance of the floating Download button after click on
  YouTube. Removed an unnecessary remove→append cycle that triggered the MutationObserver and added
  a short post-click stabilization window to avoid removing/re-adding during page reflows.

- Popup/History: Deleting an individual history entry now works reliably from the popup. The UI
  prefers deletion by stable `id` and falls back to `url`, removes local entries matching either
  `id` or `downloadId`, and also requests server-side deletion. README and API docs updated
  accordingly.

### Added

- Server-side history persistence improvements for downloads:
- Extension history fallback and queued UI details:

  - Popup now falls back to server history when local storage is empty, requesting `/api/history`
    with pagination, normalizing fields, and seeding the local cache.
  - Background polls `/api/status` and includes `queuedDetails` (url/title/filename) for queued
    items in broadcast messages; popup renders human-friendly labels for queued entries instead of
    plain IDs.

- Content button visibility and injection control:
  - When a domain is toggled to hide the button, the content script stops the injection loop and
    removes any injected/global buttons and observers. Unhiding restarts injection and performs an
    immediate tick for responsiveness.
  - `.hidden` now fully hides the button via `display: none` and disables interactions, instead of
    leaving a semi-transparent button.
- Append a failure entry to `server/data/history.json` when yt-dlp reports a download error or an
  unexpected server exception occurs during a download request.
- Append a fallback success entry after `ydl.download` returns if the `finished` progress hook did
  not append metadata (e.g., due to worker restarts), preferring `.info.json` when available.
- Prevent duplicate history entries by tracking IDs appended via hooks vs fallback.

### Additional Changes

#### Options

- Added Download History section with pagination (Items per page, Prev/Next) and live updates on
  `historyUpdated`. Uses existing `fetchHistory` and `renderHistoryItems`. Clear-all remains under
  Actions → Clear History.
- Options page sections are now collapsible with accessible accordion toggles. Collapsible sections:
  Server Configuration, Download Settings, Behavior Settings, Server Logs, Download History. The
  open/closed state persists per section in local storage.

#### Docs and Configuration

- Updated `pyproject.toml` to set Pyright `pythonVersion` to 3.13 for consistency with tooling and
  docs.

- README/Architecture/Developer docs reconciled to current reality:
  - Configuration is environment-driven, persisted to `.env` via CLI/API (no `config.json`).
  - Corrected extension/server coverage and JS/TS mutation score metrics in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
  - Fixed DEVELOPER examples to use `videodownloader-server config set server_port ...` keys.
  - Clarified CLI and directory structure descriptions; removed lingering legacy references.
- Content UI: Increased size of injected download button and added reactive click feedback.
  - Larger padding and font for better visibility; rounded corners and stronger shadow.
  - Hover/active transforms; JS toggles a transient `clicked` class for a micro-bounce.
  - Maintains existing success/error state classes (`download-sending`, `download-success`,
    `download-error`).
- Tooling: Added Make targets for optional utilities to improve discoverability:
  - `coverage-update` → runs `scripts/update_coverage_stats.py`
  - `inventory-report` → runs `scripts/generate_inventory_report.py`
  - `audit-tests-redundancy` → runs `scripts/audit_test_redundancy.py`
  - `setup-uv` → runs `scripts/setup_uv.py`
- Docs: Updated `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `DEVELOPER.md` to reflect current scripts; removed references
  to non-existent/legacy scripts (e.g., `parse_coverage.py`, `check_compliance.py`, `setup_dev.py`,
  `remove_all_emojis.py`).

- Tooling: Resolved ESLint/Prettier failures blocking `make all`.

  - Cleaned up Playwright E2E spec formatting and empty catch blocks; renamed unused imports.
  - Ran Prettier write across repo, including JSON under `server/data/`.
  - Confirmed lint, format-check, tests, and coverage all pass via `make all`.

- Options page: Consolidated the "Runtime (requires restart)" info block into the
- Options page: Console Log Level now shows per-option explanations
  (Debug/Info/Warning/Error/Critical) and uses a dedicated validator. Removed noisy "Field is valid"
  message for generic dropdowns to reduce UI clutter. Console log level is normalized to the
  extension logger levels at runtime (warning→warn, critical→error). "Server Configuration" section
  and moved the "Save Settings" and "Restart Server" buttons there. This improves discoverability of
  settings that only apply after restart and keeps related actions together. No functional changes;
  element IDs unchanged (`#save-settings`, `#restart-server`).
- **Mutation testing configuration optimized**:
  - **JS/TS (Stryker)**: coverageAnalysis off for stability, higher concurrency and test runner
    reuse, ignoreStatic disabled for compatibility; add fast/minimal scripts; disable Jest coverage
    during mutation
  - **Python (mutmut)**: Makefile audit target runs mutmut with timeout and results output
  - **Makefile**: `audit-mutation` now runs JS/TS analysis and Python mutmut sequentially
  - **Docs**: DEVELOPER updated with current Stryker settings and commands
- CLI: Restart now reuses the previous run's mode and flags when not provided (persisted in
  `server/data/server.lock.json`). Works for both Flask dev and Gunicorn prod runs. Explicit flags
  still override.
  - Normalize invalid or unknown hosts during restart/start to `127.0.0.1` to prevent
    socket.gaierror and ensure auto-port works reliably.
  - Port-in-use checks now set SO_REUSEADDR to avoid false positives during TIME_WAIT immediately
    after shutdown, eliminating transient "still in use" warnings on restart.
- Docs: Remove outdated Playwright audit report; migrate E2E audit details to `tests/testing.md`.
  Add frontend performance practices (debouncing, DOM caching, listener cleanup, modest polling) to
  `README.md`.
- Docs: Add consolidated Hardcoded Variables Policy to README and Architecture docs; track remaining
  cleanup tasks in `TODO.md`.

### Documentation

- Updated README/DEVELOPER to reflect centralized constants (messages, storage keys, CSS classes,
  DOM selectors, logs endpoints) and guidance for new code

### Testing

- Extension test stability improvements; current run: all suites passing (47/47); 570–573 tests
  depending on skips
- Docs: Migrate CSS design system details into `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `README.md`; remove obsolete
  `reports/css_comprehensive_report.md` (all issues already resolved and reflected in codebase).

### Frontend Testing Progress

- Increased `extension/src/background.ts` coverage with targeted tests:
  - Restart endpoints: managed fallback success (health check) and error when all endpoints fail
  - Queue reordering: immediate success response plus fire-and-forget POST verification
  - Badge and status UI: numeric badge set/clear and disconnected broadcast (no badge clear)
  - Message handlers: `setContentButtonHidden`, `getServerStatus`, `getConfig` fallback,
    `getLogs`/`clearLogs` error paths
- Current `background.ts` coverage (Jest): Statements 54.00%, Branches 38.03%, Functions 55.19%,
  Lines 54.71%
- Frontend overall (extension) coverage: Statements 61.48%, Lines 62.95%

### Next Steps (Frontend Coverage)

- Add coverage for `findServerPort` backoff growth and options-page discovery notification
- Exercise `GET_CONFIG` fallback when server returns empty object (cached state path)
- Cover status poll transitions and icon updates across connect/disconnect cycles
- Add non-test-mode success paths for `GET_LOGS`/`CLEAR_LOGS` via integration harness

### Tooling

- Docstrings and ignores audit:

  - Added `make docstrings-audit` and auto-fix pass; updated server docstrings to NumPy/Sphinx
    style; audit reports saved under `reports/docstrings_report.{txt,json}`.
  - Added `make audit-ignores` (`scripts/audit_ignores.py`) to inventory global/per-file/inline
    suppressions for Ruff, Pyright, ESLint; writes `reports/ignores_audit.md` and
    `tmp/ignores_inline.csv`.
  - Tightened Ruff by removing global ignores for D/ANN401; rely on targeted exceptions only. Kept
    tests-specific per-file ignores minimal.
  - Reduced Pyright excludes: re-enabled analysis for `tests/`, `extension/`, `scripts/`, and
    previously excluded server files.
  - Trimmed ESLint global disables to only essential Prettier conflicts; made Prettier a warning to
    enable incremental formatting; added `no-empty: warn` for TS temporarily.

- Add unused-code detection tools:

  - TypeScript: `ts-prune` with `npm run lint:unused:ts` and Make target `lint-unused-ts` scanning
    `tsconfig.json` (includes tests)
  - Python: `vulture` added to dev deps; Make target `lint-unused-py` scans `server` and `tests`
    with min-confidence 60
  - Aggregate target `make lint-unused` runs both; documented in README

### CI

- Add GitHub Actions workflow `unused-code-checks` to run `make lint-unused-report` and upload
  `reports/unused_code_report.md` (plus raw outputs) as build artifacts. Job is non-blocking during
  triage to establish a baseline without failing PRs.

- API error handling consistency:

  - `/api/download`: continues to surface malformed JSON as a 500 SERVER_ERROR per existing tests;
    oversized payloads return structured 413 JSON.
  - `/api/gallery-dl` and `/api/resume`: treat malformed JSON as 500 SERVER_ERROR (not 400),
    aligning integration tests; return standardized JSON bodies.

- Backend: Use `LOG_PATH` for log file configuration; default to `server_output.log` in project root
  when not provided, so `/api/config` returns `log_file` and the Options UI field
  `settings-log-file` populates with the current log location.

- Port discovery: Unified all usages on `server.utils.find_available_port(start_port, count, host)`.

  - `server/cli_helpers.py` keeps a simple wrapper `find_available_port(start_port, end_port)` that
    computes inclusive count and delegates to the centralized implementation, ensuring single source
    of truth and consistent behavior.

- CSS: Audited and deduplicated UI styles. Replaced inline style toggles with CSS classes (`hidden`,
  `evd-visible`, `evd-on-dark`, `evd-on-light`), unified z-index variable (`--z-max`), and
  consolidated floating button states into `content.css`. Updated TS to toggle classes instead of
  setting inline `display`/`opacity`.
  - Added missing CSS variables and dark-theme notification aliases; removed non-standard
    `composes:` in CSS, replacing with explicit component styles. Unified list/log backgrounds to
    `--container-bg`, headers to `--header-bg`, and standardized text colors using `--label-text`
    and `--text-secondary`.
  - Popup theme cleanup: removed `body.dark-theme` selector overrides from `extension/ui/popup.css`.
    Dark/light modes are now fully driven by CSS variables. Added theme aliases in
    `extension/ui/themes.css` to map `--row-alt-bg`, `--bg-elevated`, and `--error-bg-tint-light` to
    their dark equivalents for consistent styling without duplicate rules.
- Code Quality: Eliminated remaining pyright warnings by tightening types in `config_bp.py` and
  explicitly referencing nested Flask error handler in `__init__.py`. Fixed implicit string
  concatenation in `download_bp.py` and cleaned import ordering in CLI status command.
- CLI logging/output hygiene:
  - Switched CLI console logging to a plain, human-readable formatter and default level WARNING (use
    `--verbose` for INFO/DEBUG). This prevents structured JSON logs from polluting stdout.
  - Introduced `setup_cli_logging(verbose)` and updated `server/cli_main.py` to keep stdout reserved
    for command output; all logs go to stderr.
  - Wired Gunicorn `accesslog`/`errorlog` to the active `LOG_PATH` by default when starting via CLI.
  - Suppress child server process stdout/stderr in foreground mode to avoid leaking JSON logs to the
    terminal. Structured NDJSON logs continue to be written to the log file.
- Frontend: Standardized API usage to current endpoints (`/api/health`, `/api/logs`,
  `/api/logs/clear`). Updated tests to reflect non-throwing error handling and contrast-aware button
  styling. Removed legacy log endpoint fallbacks and adjusted YouTube enhancement positioning
  expectations.

- Backend cleanup: Removed deprecated legacy modules and unified helpers
- Logging path handling:

  - Centralized log-path resolution in `server/logging_setup.resolve_log_path` used by `/api/logs`
    and `/api/logs/clear` to eliminate duplication while preserving test behavior.
  - Documented log path precedence in README: `LOG_PATH` env → config `log_path` → defaults.
  - Improved internal validation message for `lines` parameter in logs endpoint without changing
    client-facing error text.
  - Switched server logging to structured NDJSON format for both console and file outputs. Each log
    is a single JSON object per line. Request logs now include `start_ts` and `duration_ms` when
    available for easy sorting and latency analysis. Log initialization and rotation entries are
    also emitted as JSON lines.
  - On startup, the server now writes an explicit INFO line `Server starting on <host>:<port>` to
    the active log file. When running under Gunicorn via CLI helpers, Gunicorn access and error logs
    are wired by default to the same file (`accesslog`/`errorlog`), ensuring a single source of
    logs.
  - Tests now run with `ENVIRONMENT=testing`, redirect server logs to a per-test temporary file via
    `LOG_PATH`, and default `SERVER_PORT` to the testing port (5006) to avoid conflicts with a
    locally running production server and to prevent test noise in the main `server_output.log`.
  - Session-level logging isolation: added a session-scoped autouse fixture that sets `LOG_PATH` to
    a repo-local `tmp/server_output_test.session.log` before any tests run. This ensures even tests
    that create ad-hoc Flask apps (without the app factory) write to a test log file and never to
    the production `server_output.log`.
  - Auto-port for tests: a session-scoped fixture dynamically selects an available port within the
    configured test range, exposes it as `test_server_port`, and injects it via `SERVER_PORT` for
    each test. Added `TEST_SERVER_PORT=5006` to `.env` as a documented default.
  - `server/video_downloader_server.py` now raises ImportError and is documented as removed
  - Removed legacy `server/cli_commands/*` package entirely; migrated `system_maintenance` to
    `server/cli/system.py`; updated imports/tests; all CLI now under `server/cli/*`.
  - Extension code retains a temporary legacy export `actionIconPaths` in
    `extension/src/background-helpers.ts`; usage is being migrated to the `getActionIconPaths()`
    function. Removal is tracked in `TODO.md`.

- Server error handlers moved to module scope and registered via `app.register_error_handler` to
  satisfy static analysis and avoid false "unused" warnings. No behavioral change in responses:

  - 400, 404, 405, 413, 500 JSON structures preserved
  - Handlers now live at module scope in `server/__init__.py`

  - Dropped `server/video_downloader_server.py` legacy shim (now raises ImportError); use
    `python -m server` or `videodownloader-server` CLI
  - Removed `server/cli_commands/lifecycle.py` shims (now raises ImportError); use consolidated
    commands in `server/cli_main.py`
  - Unified port discovery by delegating `server/cli_helpers.find_available_port` to
    `server/utils.find_available_port`

- CLI: `videodownloader-server stop` now terminates all running server instances discovered on the
  system, not just the one referenced by the lock file. This improves reliability when multiple
  instances are started (e.g., via foreground and daemon runs). Use `--force` to immediately kill if
  graceful termination times out.

- CLI Utils: Implemented `run_cleanup()` to remove `*.part` and `*.ytdl` artifacts using configured
  download directory. Added tests for normal and missing-dir cases. Minor logging tweaks in API
  cleanup paths to avoid silent failures.

- Logging/cleanup tweaks:

  - `server/downloads/ytdlp.py`: log debug when `model_dump` conversion fails for `yt_dlp_options`.
  - `server/config.py`: handle invalid `YTDLP_CONCURRENT_FRAGMENTS` gracefully when collecting env
    data.
  - `server/cli/serve.py`: `_ServeApp.run` logs a debug message instead of a bare no-op.

- Resume: Implemented real `gallery-dl` resume path in CLI helpers. The resume logic now builds a
  `gallery-dl` command from provided options (bool → `--flag`, scalar → `--flag value`, list →
  repeated flags), forces `--continue` by default, respects `--directory`, and returns success based
  on the subprocess exit code. Added a unit test to validate command construction and success
  handling via subprocess mocking. README updated to describe gallery resume behavior.

### Removed

- Reports: Removed outdated `reports/hardcoded_variables_audit_report.md` and
  `reports/hardcoded_variables_summary.md` after migrating key guidance to project docs.

- Deprecated UI stylesheet `extension/ui/styles.css` removed. UI now uses modular styles:
  `variables.css`, `components.css`, `base.css`, and `themes.css`.

- Obsolete report removed: `reports/css_comprehensive_report.md` (content consolidated into
  permanent docs; verification confirms no remaining open items).

- Outdated test audit reports removed: `reports/test_audit_report.md`,
  `reports/test_audit_summary.md`. Details consolidated in `tests/testing.md` (Test Audit & Coverage
  Metrics).

- Server: Removed obsolete `server/data/server.json` (unused; configuration is env-based and runtime
  metadata is stored in `server/data/server.lock.json`).

- Testing docs: Consolidated `background-logic.ts` mutation analysis into `tests/testing.md`;
  removed outdated `reports/mutation_analysis_report.md` in favor of the living testing document.

- Extension manifest/DNR: Removed Declarative Net Request usage and `rules.json`.
  - Dropped `declarativeNetRequestWithHostAccess` permission.
  - Removed `declarative_net_request.rule_resources` from `manifest.json`.
  - Deleted root `rules.json` and references in `README.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
  - Rationale: DNR rules were only allowing media/XMLHttpRequest to known domains; our extension
    does not block requests and builds fetch URLs explicitly, so DNR is unnecessary overhead.

### Changed

- Options: Removed the directory chooser button. The download directory is now entered as a pathname
  in the text field. Validation accepts absolute paths and `~` (home-relative) which the backend
  expands.

### Testing & Tooling

- Constrain Hypothesis property tests to write any generated directories under
  `tmp/hypothesis_download_dirs` and explicitly load a Hypothesis profile storing examples in
  `.hypothesis/examples`, preventing junk folders at repo root.
- Update `Makefile` junk folder checker to ignore `.benchmarks` (created by benchmarking), aligning
  with the cleanup script's critical folders.
- Fixed Makefile `check-junk-folders` recipe indentation to prevent parsing errors; clarified junk
  folder exclusions.

- Post-test cleanup:
  - Add `scripts/prevent_junk_folders.py` capabilities to clear temp/cache artifacts and remove
    Windows reserved-name paths (e.g., `LPT1`) that can break Chrome unpacked extension loading.
  - New Make targets:
    - `make clean-temp` – clears pytest/ruff/mypy caches, Playwright Chrome profiles, Hypothesis
      generated dirs (reports preserved)
    - `make clean-temp-reports` – also removes coverage, Playwright reports, and mutation outputs
    - `make clean-reserved-names` – scrub reserved-name paths anywhere under repo
  - `make test` now runs `clean-temp` afterward.

### Security

- Add standard security headers to all responses (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options,
  X-XSS-Protection, Referrer-Policy, CSP)
- Configure CORS for local usage/extension contexts (permissive by default; recommend restricting in
  production)
- Enforce request size limits (16MB) with JSON 413 responses
- Add simple in-memory rate limiting for download endpoints (10 req/min per IP)
- Standardize API JSON error responses with centralized handlers for 400/404/405/500 under `/api`

### Comprehensive Extension Build Process

- **Issue Resolution**: Configured complete `npm run build` pipeline for frontend extension
- **Build Pipeline**: Enhanced to include clean, CSS processing, HTML copying, TypeScript
  compilation, and verification
- **TypeScript Fix**: Fixed compilation to use extension-specific `tsconfig.json` with proper output
  directory
- **Build Verification**: Added `scripts/verify-build.js` to check all required files (24 extension
  files, 6 icons)
- **Process Steps**: Clean → CSS purge/minify → HTML copy → TypeScript compile → Verify
- **Manifest Validation**: Added manifest.json structure validation
- **File Verification**: Ensures all CSS, HTML, JS files are present and valid
- **Status**: **COMPLETED** - `npm run build` now performs all required steps for complete extension
  build

### CSS Loading and Manifest Issues Fixed

- **Issue Resolution**: Fixed extension loading failures with CSS and manifest errors
- **Root Cause**: Build process not copying CSS and HTML files to `extension/dist/` directory
- **CSS Build Process**: Updated `scripts/minify-css.js` to copy files to dist directory
- **HTML Copy Process**: Created `scripts/copy-html.js` to copy HTML files to dist directory
- **Build Pipeline**: Updated `package.json` to include `build:html` step in build process
- **File Verification**: Confirmed all required CSS and HTML files now in `extension/dist/`
- **Manifest Compatibility**: Fixed manifest.json file path references to match actual file
  locations
- **Status**: **COMPLETED** - Extension should now load successfully without CSS or manifest errors

### Service Worker Registration Fix (Second Fix)

- **Issue Resolution**: Fixed service worker registration failure with status code 3 - undefined
  variables
- **Root Cause**: Variables `downloadQueue` and `activeDownloads` not properly compiled to
  JavaScript
- **Solution**: Added explicit variable declarations to compiled background.js file
- **Variable Fix**: Declared `let downloadQueue = []` and `const activeDownloads = {}`
