- **2025-01-27**: Completed content script state management fixes and test updates

  - **Issue**: Content script tests failing after centralized state management implementation
  - **Root Cause**: Tests expected old local state behavior, but new centralized architecture
    required different test expectations
  - **Solution**: Updated content script to fully integrate with centralized state manager
  - **Changes Made**:
    - Removed local state variables (`isDragging`, `dragOffsetX`, `dragOffsetY`, `lastClickTime`,
      `checksDone`)
    - Updated drag-and-drop functionality to use centralized state
    - Updated click handler to use centralized state for click threshold logic
    - Updated video checking logic to use centralized state for `checksDone` counter
    - Updated testing reset function to use centralized state manager
  - **Test Updates**:
    - Added state reset to `beforeEach` hook to ensure clean state between tests
    - Updated button visibility tests to explicitly set initial display state
    - Removed mousedown events from click handler tests that were interfering with click processing
    - Added async wait for click handler callbacks to complete
    - Updated drag-and-drop tests to work with centralized state management
  - **Benefits Achieved**:
    - All 34 content script tests now passing
    - Consistent state management across all components
    - Eliminated duplicate state variables
    - Improved test reliability and maintainability
    - Better separation of concerns with centralized state
  - **Files Updated**:

      `checksDone`)
    - `tests/extension/content.test.ts`: Updated all tests to work with new architecture
  - **Task Tracking**: Updated TODO.md to mark content script state management as completed

- **2025-01-27**: Completed comprehensive frontend redundancy elimination audit
