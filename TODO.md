- **Auto-fixable issues**: Applied formatting fixes

### Key Fixes Applied

#### 1. **TypeScript Configuration** [PASS]

- Added DOM library support (`"lib": ["es6", "dom"]`)
- Installed `@types/chrome` for extension development
- Fixed `NodeJS.Timeout` → `number` type for browser compatibility
- Updated `tsconfig.json` with proper type definitions

#### 2. **Python Type Annotation Compatibility** [PASS]

- **Pyright Configuration**: Created `pyrightconfig.json` targeting Python 3.13
- **Union Syntax**: Configured pyright to accept modern `|` syntax (Python 3.10+)

**Python Ruff**: [PASS] **All checks passing**  
**Python Pyright**: [PASS] **0 errors, 5 warnings** (excellent improvement from 368 errors)

### Next Steps

The remaining pyright warnings are mostly about:

- **Third-party library limitations** (tqdm's set_postfix, psutil's read_bytes/write_bytes) - These
  are expected
- **Optional imports** (dotenv) - These are expected when the package is not installed
- **Complex type inference** (dict.get() methods, list comprehensions) - These are edge cases where
  pyright can't fully infer types

These are **non-blocking warnings** that don't affect functionality and represent the limits of
static type inference.
